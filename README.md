<b>How can you get involved?</b>

There are several ways you can get involved. If you are a student you could apply for an internship with EugeneTech. Maybe youâ€™re currently working on a project or event you would like to discuss you could be a special guest or if would simply like to volunteer your time helping out with things like post production, our community calendar and social media, that could be an option as well.
